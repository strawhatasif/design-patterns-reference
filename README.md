# design-patterns-reference

These are files that I've modified a little (to use Java8 in some cases, or to update the style) and they are based off of the Udemy course "Experience Design Patterns"
Design Patterns are based on the GoF (Gang of Four) 

@See http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/wlyle/430/rc008-designpatterns_online.pdf for a cheat sheet of design patterns
